here it tells you how to connect to device https://forum.unity.com/threads/attaching-monodevelop-debugger-to-an-android-device.245814/

didn't get this to work

debugging unity is VERY complex
it happens over wifi
it debugs the assembly output from the csharp over wifi

i got logcat to work
so printf debugging (also general errors are logged in logcat)

go find the Android Sdk location 
(on linux its ~/Android/Sdk. on mac is aparently  ~/Library/Android/sdk)

go here in android studio if you can't find it:
File -> Other settings -> Default Project Structure menu invokes dialog box where you can see Android SDK Location.

or go here if you still can't find it
https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/93209/how-would-i-find-the-sdk-folder-for-android-studio-so-i-can-build-my-unity-proje



here is some terminal output for logcat


    ~/Android/Sdk/platform-tools $ ./adb logcat -s Unity
    adb server version (36) doesn't match this client (40); killing...
    * daemon started successfully
    --------- beginning of main
    --------- beginning of system


so adb is in platform-tools in the SDK location

now you have a low-key debugger
